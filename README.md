# BeastForge
## Can you tame the silicon beast with your brain ?

## Come Join the Club
Are you capable of running your app's logic in a highly constrained enviornment ? Do you really know what mechanical simpathy means ? 
Test it out on one of the VMs setups in this repository, you'll be interacting directly with the hardware, building your own tiny OS layer from scratch to save yourself. 
Are you interested ? Clone this repository, install QEMU and start coding right now in any low-level language you want (no standard library allowed).

## Why This Exists ?
Nowadays, developers are so soaked in abstractions that they forget how the machine actually works, or worse, they never learned it in the first place. This forge is a response to that, 
it provides a virtual machine with a modern architecture, but capped to the level of an ENIAC, so you can **feel** every branch misprediction, you can **see** what data alignment and cache-coherence really means. This approach can be vastly superior to reading books and attending classes, as you'll be actually fighting your own logic to make it barely runnable on this machine.

## Who is this for ?
Anyone wanting to actually grasp computer architecture and low-level programming. If you want to get better at C programming, use it. If you want to actually feel the zero-cost abstractions of Rust, use it. If you want to Assembly your way into BeastForge, like a giga-chad monster programmer, use it.
