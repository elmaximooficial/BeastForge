# Purpose
Here, you'll learn how a video driver works, how to put pixels on a screen and manipulate said pixels.

# Objectives
    - Print ASCII art on the screen
    - Change the art as the user presses pre-defined keys
    - Translate and the art when the user presses one of (w | a | s | d), rotate the art when the user presses Shift + (a | d)
    - Create pixel-art on the screen, with the same rotation, translation and changing as with the ASCII art

# Optional
    - Rotate along the Y axis when the user presses Shift + (w | s)
    - Scale the art when the user presses Ctrl + (a | d) (x--, x++) or Ctrl + (s | w) (y--, y++)
    - Colorize the ASCII Art
